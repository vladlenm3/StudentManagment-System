# Overview

This program is a student managment system. The professor is able to log in to his account and manage
studentâ€™s information. For example, he can enter students id, display the information about all
students, edit their grades etc. I used object-oriented principles for this project. The professors login
information is stored in a file and verified during the login process.

I chose this project in order to practice concepts and syntax of the C# language.

# Future Work

- Add more methods that will let professors add and remove students to a class.
- Set up a login account for student as well.
- Format the code better and add more descriptive names for all variables.
